# Go Fishing
Play Go-Fishing here! https://jannyzhao.github.io/go-fishing/

## Background
Go Fishing is inspiried by a popular mini game from Club Penguin. The goal is to catch as many fish as you can in the time alloted. Every time the animating hook reaches a swimming fish, the points will increase by 5 or 10, depending on the size of the fish. Careful! The small fish move faster but are worth twice the points! Happy Fishing :)
